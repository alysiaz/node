Project Proposal: Describe your chosen problem and whether you have access to relevant data.
1.	Draft a well-formed problem statement relevant to a business problem affecting your team, division, or organization.
o	Poverty is a growing problem across the globe. It leads to slower per capital growth rate and reduces a country’s ability to compete in a world market. Studies show that one way to combat poverty is to increase the population’s average education level. 
2.	Include the following elements:
o	Hypothesis/assumptions
1.	Increasing the average education level for population will decrease rates of poverty within that population over time. 
o	Goals and success metrics
1.	Be able to plot a correlation between decreasing poverty and increasing average education
2.	Be able to link poverty as dependent on education
o	Risks or limitations
1.	A population’s decrease in poverty can be due to multiple factors and may not be solely due to increased education. This may increase the difficulty to link education and poverty together.
3.	Identify at least one relevant internal dataset and confirm that you have (or can get) the right access permissions.
